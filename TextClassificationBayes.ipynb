    "# Text Classification and Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity's learning goals are to work towards being able to...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify and describe the input and output structure for text classification tasks\n",
    "2. Explain the differences between generative and discriminative models for classification tasks\n",
    "3. Define and implement Naive Bayes for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief Review - Classification and Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of classification is to assign a *class* (or *label*) to a *data point*. That is, given some kind of data, you want to determine which class it belongs to. Depending on the kind of classification task, these labels can vary. Text classification refers to a family of tasks where the data points in question come in text form. Formally, a text classification problem can be framed as one where a model is given a string of tokens $\\omega \\in \\Sigma^*$ and must assign it a class $c \\in C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in *sentiment analysis*, a model is given some text (a movie review, or comments on media content, social media messages about a brand) and must label it's *sentiment*: is it positive, negative, or neutral? The classes $C$ here would be the labels *positive*, *negative*, and *neutral*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *language identification* (or language ID), a model is given some text and must decide what language that text is written in. The classes here would be some set of languages, with perhaps a class indicating that the language couldn't be identified (or to capture languages we may have missed, not unlike an UNK token). \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these examples, there are many other tasks that fall under this label, including (if we're careful about how we frame them) language modeling or grammar checking!\n",
    "\n",
    "In a probabilistic framework, our instinct should be to model $p(c \\mid \\omega)$ --- the likelihood of the category given the text input. Naive Bayes makes a few moves to make this a usable strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, since we are meant to label outputs, we assign $\\omega$ the category $c \\in C$ that maximizes $p(c \\mid \\omega)$. We write this as $\\text{arg}\\max\\limits_{c \\in C} p(c \\mid \\omega)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we observe that we can apply Bayes Rule to show that $p(c \\mid \\omega) = \\frac{p(\\omega \\mid c)p(c)}{p(\\omega)}$. Thus, we can say that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{arg} \\max\\limits_{c \\in C} p(c \\mid \\omega) = \\text{arg} \\max\\limits_{c \\in C} \\frac{p(\\omega \\mid c)p(c)}{p(\\omega)} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we observe that $p(\\omega)$ will be the same for everything we're taking the argmax over. That is, we want to compare $\\frac{p(\\omega \\mid c)p(c)}{p(\\omega)}$ for every possible value of $c$, but changing $c$ doesn't change $p(\\omega)$, so we can ignore it when computing the argmax. Thus, we get that our label for the string $\\omega$ should be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{arg} \\max\\limits_{c \\in C} p(c \\mid \\omega) = \\text{arg} \\max\\limits_{c \\in C} p(\\omega \\mid c)p(c) $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to determine a way to estimate $p(\\omega \\mid c)$ (a *generative* model of the data (think of this as a language model specifically for class $c$!) and $p(c)$ (a probability distribution over the classes themselves!). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a Naive Bayes classifier! Following J&M, we will model our text as a *bag-of-words* --- that is, our features are going to be the words that appear in our text. Since this is Naive Bayes, we will assume our features are *indepedendent*, which means their we can decompose $p(\\omega \\mid c)$ into a product of the conditional probabilities of each feature (i.e., word): $\\prod_{w \\in \\omega} p(w \\mid C)$. Note that this is just a class-specific unigram LM!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's build the unigram LM part of our model. We'll load in a subset of the IMDB dataset released by [Maas et al. (2011)](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf). This subset consists of 2500 IMDB reviews (1250 positive and 1250 negative) for training and 1000 (500 positive and 500 negative) for testing. "
